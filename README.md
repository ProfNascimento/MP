# Multidimensional Projection (MP) techniques

This repository is related to the published article *Ortigossa, E.S.; Dias, F.F.; Nascimento, D.C.d. Getting over High-Dimensionality: How Multidimensional Projection Methods Can Assist Data Science. Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 6799. https://doi.org/10.3390/app12136799*. 

We illustrate two problems, from a genetic experiment (supervised) and text mining (non-supervised), presenting solutions through multidimensional projection application, adopting multidimensional projection techniques and shows example codes in Python and R languages.

<Womens Clothing E-Commerce Reviews.csv> This dataset was adopted from the KAGGLE website, which is related to the Women’s Clothing E-Commerce database. These data were anonymous recorded reviews derived from customers, which its dataset shows ten features (Clothing ID, reviewers Age, Title, Review Text, Rating, Recommended IND, Positive Feedback Count, Division Name, Department Name, and Class Name). The R script associated with the data analysis is MP_text.R
